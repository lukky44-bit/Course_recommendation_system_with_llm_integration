This is a MERN stack project (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) for a course recommendation web app. The backend (Node/Express) will act as a proxy to the FastAPI recommendation API running in the parent directory. The frontend (React) will allow users to input a query and display recommended courses.
